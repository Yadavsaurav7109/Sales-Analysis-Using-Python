# Overview of Project: 
1) Sales Data Analysis and Visualization
This project is aimed at analyzing and visualizing sales data to uncover key insights about customer behavior, regional performance, and sales trends across different age groups. The analysis is conducted using Python's pandas library for data manipulation and seaborn for visualization. The primary objectives of the project include:

2) Identifying Top Performing States:
We analyze the dataset to determine which states generate the highest number of orders, providing valuable insights into regional performance.

3) Sales by Age Group:
We investigate how different age groups contribute to the total sales amount, helping to understand the demographics driving the highest revenue.

4) Data Visualization:
The project leverages seaborn to create visually appealing bar plots, highlighting the key findings from the data, such as the top 10 states by orders and the contribution of different age groups to sales.

The analysis is designed to help businesses or stakeholders make data-driven decisions by identifying which regions and demographics are the most lucrative and need more attention in terms of marketing and resource allocation.

# Project Learnings

1) Performed data cleaning and manipulation.

2) Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

3) Improved customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupation, gender and age groups.

4) Improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands.
